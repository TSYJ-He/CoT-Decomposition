Example 1:  
Q: Carla is downloading a 200GB file at 2GB/min. She downloads 40% of it, then restarts her computer for 20 minutes, and finally downloads the entire file again. How long does it take in total?  
A: First, calculate the time to download 40% of the file: 200 × 0.4 ÷ 2 = 40 minutes.  
Then add the 20-minute restart.  
Finally, download the full 200GB: 200 ÷ 2 = 100 minutes.  
Total time = 40 + 20 + 100 = 160 minutes.  
Answer: 160  

Example 2:  
Q: A train travels 60 km/h for 2 hours and then 40 km/h for 3 hours. What is the total distance?  
A: First, compute distance for each segment: 60 × 2 = 120 km, 40 × 3 = 120 km.  
Add the segments: 120 + 120 = 240.  
Answer: 240
